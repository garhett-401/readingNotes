## PURPOSE SHEET

### Pinpoint my values


1. What motivates me to get up in the morning?
  - I am motivated by a purpose driven life. I am motivated by my own perception of how my life is going and where its going. When my wife left me and I moved into my own apartment with my dog and it seemed like my life was going nowhere with no solution in sight, I tried to take my life. It wasn't until a few conversations with others that I care about that I began to talk about my struggles and made a profound choice to not suffer anymore. Having purpose that I love and enjoy is what gets me up in the morning. 

2. What keeps me up at night? 
  - I have thoughts and feelings that the big things im up to in life will never come to fruition. 

3. What am I doing when I'm at my best?
  - I am living my best life by being a solid contribution to others around me and constantly trying to see ways that I can continue doing so through areas of life that are important to me.

4. Why am I bothered by what bothers me? 
  - This is a good question. I get bothered by the voice in my head that tells me I'm not good enough. However, I'm human and that will never stop occuring from time to time, but why it doesn't happen that much at all is because I don't give that voice power. When I have thoughts and feelings that are negative, I simply say to myself "thanks for sharing, I disagree" and drive on. 

5. Why do I do the work I do?
  - Refer to my answer for number 3. It is the reason I do what I do and what I'm doing when I'm at my best.

6. Why do I live where I live?
  - I live where I live because I live where I live. Thats it. Although, I have a pretty sweet view of Downtown accross lake union from my place in wallingford. When I was apartment hunting, this place rose above the rest for that reason.

7. Why do I buy what I buy?
  - I don't know how to answer this. I'm not a material person. I don't own a lot of possessions. The material stuff that matters are what enlightens me. I love gaming so I have a powerful PC to help me stay connected to others that also Like to game. I own a paddleboard to go out on lake union so I can be at peace with myself and not think about anything in that moment. I buy things that make me feel whole.

8. Why do I long for what I long for?
  - I long for the goals I have set out to achieve. I understand that I have the capacity and the ability to create my life how I want to create it so I broke that down into steps to achieve it. All the "longing" that I have is directed toward accomplishing those things.

9. Why do I read and watch what I do?
  - Again, this ties into creating the life I want to live. Everything I do in media is either to further my ability to achieve those goals, or to relax and step back from focusing on those goals at the time.

10. Why do I admire who I admire?
  - Those I admire have the same core beliefs and desires I do. I want the world to work for everyone. I want everyone to believe that they are capable of anything and I listen to leaders who inspire those beliefs. I also admire people who sacrafice for all of us. An example is Elon Musk, he wants to solve global climate change, one of the ways he did that was by starting Tesla and "open sourced" all the technology so other companies could follow suit and develope their own electric cars. THAT'S inspiring.

11. When am I happy? 
  - I'm always happy. If I'm not, it's because I have given in to my own self doubt at the time and I haven't chosen to do anything about that yet.

12. Why do I have the relationships that I have? 
  - This one is hard to answer. As I mentioned before I'm going through a divorce. The last 5 years has taught me alot about what I want and whom I want to have relationships with and currently I don't want any. I want to work on myself and the goals I have set out to accomplish. Friends that come along for the ride have similar goals I do, and they tend to be the relationships I work on. Thats the best way I can answer that.


### Consider my options

###### Opportunities

1. I want to be a self-community made man. Meaning, I want to pave my own path using my community as a resource to accomplish all the things I'm setting out to accomplish. Once that's done then I become the community resource, and I get to give back to everyone in it so that we may all win. 

2. I want financial freedom in a BIG way. Meaning I want to live very comfortably so that I may fund others dreams.

3. I want to own a yacht and sail around all over the place.

4. I want to be able to say I started a tech company that sold for 50 million dollars.

5. I want to be known for inspiring others.

###### Core Values

1. I believe the world should work for everyone.

2. I believe that myself and others have a responsibility to help others when the world doesn't work for them. 

3. I believe everyone should be able to pursue happiness in anyway they see fit unencumbered by anyone else (with exception to life and liberty).

4. I believe that the systems and companies I help develope should reflect and live by my core beliefs, and if they don't it is my responsibility to change that.

5. I believe that pineapple does not belong on pizza. And if someone does not share that belief, then I will support them in any way to obtain more pineapple pizza.


#### What have I decided is my purpose?

My purpose is to create profound connections in business and life. And through my education and experience, enhance the culture of any organization or community Iâ€™m a part of. Through which, I will share in my successes so that others may have opportunities to thrive.


### Make room for what you love.

##### Maximize

1. Self developement, I must work on myself more and more to be able to help others.

2. Self reflection, I should not be stuck in my ways and always treat life as being fluid. People change, I may change and I should always be present to my changing values.

3. Time for myself. I need to be aware when I'm getting burned out. When that happens, my core values to a back seat and I become a man of non-action.

##### Minimize

1. Self doubt. Theres no room for it. Scotamas are an ever present misguiding light in our minds and I need to spend less time reveling in them.

2. Not sleeping. I tend to get little sleep and that needs to change for me to be an effective human being.
