### ACL

A CMS might â€¦

Allow admin users to create categories, content, manage user accounts, and run reports
Allow editor users to create, edit and delete existing content, but not see or manage user accounts
Allow guest users to access (read) content
Allow user users (logged in users) to access (read) content and apply a thumbs-up/down to content, but not change the actual content


In our RESTful APIs, it is important to limit access to clients based on credentials. This means a user (Foo) should not be able to delete a users (Bar) resource, unless Bar said that Foo is allowed to. Limiting what actions a user can preform on a given resource is called Access Control. A user can be given a token at signup and login, and that user can pass that token back to the server on requests with limited access controls. Once the server parses the token, it can determine if the user is authorized to preform the request.
